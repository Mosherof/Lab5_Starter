1. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because seeing as it needs to account for writing and sending a message to another user, it seems to large scale to debug as a whole. Moreover, this component interacts with other people's applications, and unit testing is unable to test for these types of functions.
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature because it is something that can be tested small scale, executed quickly, and would likely not be affected by other app features. Additionlly, it can function as an individual component.
